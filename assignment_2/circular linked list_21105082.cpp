// [Q->2] What are the practical applications of a circular linked list? 
/*Application of Circular Linked Lists:
->Circular Linked Lists can be used to manage the computing resources of the computer.
->Data structures such as stacks and queues are implemented with the help of the circular linked lists.
->Circular Linked List is also used in the implementation of advanced data structures such as a Fibonacci Heap.
->It is also used in computer networking for token scheduling. */
